        <p>Hi, everyone! Let me introduce myself. My name is Caitlin Rose Sockin, I am 21 years old, and characteristically a very short, spunky red-headed woman!</p>

        <p>I first became interested in group fitness when I took Zumba and cardio kickboxing classes at UNC Campus Recreation and realized, "hey, this is something I could see myself loving to instruct!" In May 2019, I took a group fitness instructor course through a UNC program, and soon after obtained my professional American Council of Exercise (ACE) certification. In Fall 2019, I began to teach cardio kickboxing, aerobic step, and core at my university gym. In Spring 2020, I started off the semester teaching those formats plus cardio dance, until COVID-19 threw a wrench in the whole group fitness experience.</p>
        
        <p>Teaching group fitness, between the choreography and interaction with participants, was something I continue to adore with my whole heart, so I took to the internet to spread my love for group fitness through online videos. I had been doing fitness classes on YouTube before this period of time to try to improve my form and skillset, but once COVID-19 hit, I thought I would give it ago. In late March/Early April 2020 then emerged Caitlin Sockin It Fitness. I put videos out to the public a couple times a week, and kept this up until present day :) In 2020, I connected with online fitness professionals such as Christina Dorner of CDornerFitness and Jennifer Lewis of Cardio Party Mashup Fitness, and with their help, raised $2k for Feeding America! That is the one weekly event I am most proud of achieving thus far.</p>

        <p>I rebranded in 2021 to Caitlin Sockin Dynamic Fitness. I chose the word dynamic because of its multiple meanings. 1) dynamic stretching and movement involves moving through the motions to increase body mobilty. 2) dynamics in music are important to me, as I specifically choreograph to the music...it's just my style! and 3) dynamic expression, as this is a space for you to express yourself fully and freely without judgement :)</p>
        
        <p>That leads the timeline to present day! I upload around twice a week, doing live classes occassionally. I also help manage Chris's YouTube Channel, CDornerFitness. As the world returns to normalcy following COVID-19, I hope to still be online teaching wonderful participants from all over the world, while also teaching live classes once again at local gyms.</p>
